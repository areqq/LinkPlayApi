The current version is to only a very limited extent reviewed and improved with regards to the Google translation.

The same protocol is used by the Multiroom receivers branded, Roxcore, sold by Kjell&Company in Scandinavia.
When searching internet for these devices, one can find out that the above brands are OEM for a company called [Linkplay](http://linkplay.com). This explains why there are a number of devices supporting the same REST like interface.

A list of devices controlled by this protocol is [here](devices.md).

# Presentation and list of interfaces

## Overview
In addition to being compatible with the DLNA and Airplay streaming protocols, Sonoé IEast also offers local file playback via Mirco SD card,
Multi-room, audio streaming controon different Sonoé iEast, transmission
User-defined read control and other functions, all with
User-friendly controand wireless WIFI Audio technology.

In addition, we developed an API allowing interaction with Sonoé
IEast mainly via http-type query.

The HTTP (get method) request is sent to the embedded Web server in Sonoé iEast,
it is analyzed, an a response is returned by Sonoé iEast and the corresponding function is executed. The query and reply issued by Sonoé iEast is in JSON format.

Query Format http: command is:

Httpapi.asp? Command = setPlayerCmd: play: uri

http://a.b..c.d/httpapi.asp = ********? Command =
or
Httpapi.asp? Command = setPlayerCmd: play

Example: Play Internet Radio

IP address of Sonoé iEast: 10.10.10.254
- Command: Play

http://10.10.10.254/httpapi.asp?command=setPlayerCmd:play:http://pr320.pinguinradio.nl/listen.pls 

The IP address of Sonoé iEast can be obtained by looking upnp such as
10.10.10.254 (url assume the following interfaces 10.10.10.254 IP)

Example: Play from NAS

http:///10.10.10.254/httpapi.asp?command=setPlayerCmd:play:http://NasAddress/fichier.mp3

The current specification is dated: 15/05/2016
